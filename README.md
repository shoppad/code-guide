# Code Guide

Code Guide is a project for documenting standards for developing flexible, durable, and sustainable HTML and CSS. It comes from years of experience writing code on projects of all sizes. This is a fork of Pixel Union's Code Guide, originally forked from mdo's version.

## Local GitHub Pages

If you want to contribute to the guide but want to check out how it's going to look first you can fire it up locally with Jekyll.

1. Install Jekyll

    ```bash
    gem install jekyll
    ```

2. Run the server

    ```bash
    jekyll serve --watch
    ```

Done! You can now navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:4000` (note: Jekyll will tell you where to look if it doesn't use that for your machine) and see the GitHub pages.
